The Admin Interface will include visualizations of the entire systemâ€™s operation and performance metrics aggregated by querying from Active User Table within the Data- base. The Management Console will provide controls more catered towards individual customer support, such as individual system performance reports and access to User-Device Profiles Tables from the Database. Both the Admin Interface and Management Console will provide auditing fea- tures at varying levels of control. (React JS as development framework).
